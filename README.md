## Introduction

The project is a simple calculator that can be downloaded as a PWA.

## Motivation

The main motivation was to understand how a PWA works and learn how to properly implement it in to my tech stack.

## Decisions

### Technologies

#### Windi CSS

Initially, MUI was chosen as the UI framework, till I realized that building my own components would be faster than customizing MUI to fit the project.
